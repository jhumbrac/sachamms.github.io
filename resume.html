	<p> Painting has been Liefje Smith’s passion since childhood. Her name is Scandinavian and is pronounced Leaf-ya. She comes from a family of artists, sculptors, and architects who served as early mentors. With a background and former career in design and interior architecture, the many years of drawing and working with color and texture would eventually express themselves on canvas. Along the way, and while living in Japan, Smith worked as a professional illustrator with the U.S. Army.  The artisans of Japan became a strong influence on her sense of color, design, and clear vision of expression. Smith attended graduate school at the University of Illinois and studied independently under the renowned landscape and abstract artist (and author) Edward Betts. After many years as a design director of commercial interiors, she was able to return to her first love- acrylic painting.  Liefje’s work is driven by strong color and design. Her improvisational style expresses creativity that is original and vibrant. Through her personal vocabulary of shapes, color, and calligraphy, her intention is to bring joy and intrigue to the viewer by creating visual poetry on canvas.
