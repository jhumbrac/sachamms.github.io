		<h1>artist resume</h1>
		
		<p>Painting has been Liefje Smith’s passion since childhood. It seems her career in the arts was pre-destined. She comes from a family of artists, sculptors and architects who served as early mentors. (Her name is Scandinavian and is pronounced Leaf-ya.) She followed the family art path and forged a career in design and interior architecture. Her many years of drawing and working with color and texture are a prominent influence in her work as a fine art painter.  She lived in Japan for several years, when her husband, a naval officer, was stationed there. In terms of her art, the experience was profound.  “My exposure to the contemporary artists of Japan greatly influenced my sense of color, design and clear vision of expression, and that is inherent in my work today,” she says. </p>
		<p>Smith notes a second major influence on her art when she attended graduate school at the University of Illinois and studied independently under the renowned landscape and abstract artist and author, Edward Betts. “His improvisational style spoke to me and suited what I discovered was truly my style. From him, I learned to trust my own voice.” After many years as a design director of commercial interiors, she returned to her first love of painting.</p>
		<p>Smith’s work hangs in a number of private and corporate collections. She is represented by Watson Gallery in Atlanta, Marguerite’s on Dresden in Brookhaven, Georgia, Fischer Galleries in Jackson, Mississippi and Fairfax Gallery in Jacksonville, Florida. An award-winning artist, she has had many solo shows in metro Atlanta and Jackson, Mississippi and has been in a number of group shows in the Southeast.</p>
