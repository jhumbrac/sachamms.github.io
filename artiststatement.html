	<h1> artist statement </h1>
	<p> Liefje’s abstract paintings are driven by color and design. Coming from over twenty-five years of experience in the architectural design world, these themes are second nature in her expressions on canvas.  
	Her influences include Japanese design, her teacher, Edwards Betts’s improvisational style, and her friend Elsie Dresch’s joy of creating. 
	</p>
	<p>Color becomes form and movement by creating rhythms of scale through various shape, texture and marks which invites the viewer to continually explore the surface. Large format canvases provide the room for very physical and personal expression with the acrylic medium. Acrylic paint applied in varying degrees of thickness - from opaque to transparent offers spectacular color and great flexibility which suits the improvisational spirit of her painting style. Through the articulation of her fearless use of color and personal calligraphy, Liefje’s paintings evoke spontaneity, freedom, and joy. The work is executed in many layers and she finds the most challenging part is to know when to call the work “done”. Liefje shares that “Completing the painting is a journey with sometimes unexpected turns expressing the energy of the day and rhythms of life.”   It is her intention to express visual poetry that brings joy, intrigue, and personal meaning to the viewer.
